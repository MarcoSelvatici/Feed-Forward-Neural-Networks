# Feed-Forward-Neural-Networks
Two feed forward neural network implementation (with keras and tensorflow).
### Keras
In this implementation you can find a clear and reusable implementation of a feed-forward neural network.<br>
In particular, I applied it to an OpenAI Gym environment (CartPole).
### Tensorflow
This implementation contains both a neural network and a genetic algorithm (to create the training samples for the network).
In the code, the algorithm is used to easily solve a quite difficult OpenAI Gym environment (LunarLander).
